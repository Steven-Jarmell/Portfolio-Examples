                    <p>
                        I am recent alumni from the University of Pittsburgh
                        where I led the Pittsburgh Panthers to an ACC
                        Championship, was named first-team All-American, broke
                        multiple school records, and was a finalist for the
                        Heisman Trophy.

                </div>

                    <p>
                        I bring a strong sense of leadership and a relentless
                        work ethic to the field and any pursuit I embark on.
                        Whether it's rallying my team in the final moments of a
                        high-stakes game or setting an example through my
                        dedication to training and improvement, I strive to
                        inspire and elevate those around me.

                            As the Starting Quarterback for the Pittsburgh
                            Steelers, I was responsible for leading the team's
                            offense, demonstrating strong leadership skills both
                            on and off the field.

                        <p>
                            At Nvidia, I contributed to cutting-edge
                            developments in self-driving AI technology,
                            leveraging expertise in machine learning and
                            computer vision to advance autonomous vehicle
                            capabilities and enhance safety on the road.
                            Collaborated with cross-functional teams to design
                            and implement innovative solutions, demonstrating a
                            commitment to pushing the boundaries of AI in the
                            automotive industry.

                    <p>
                        Utilized C++ to build a machine learning model that
                        predicts the outcome of football games (e.g., win, lose,
                        or draw) based on historical game data, including team
                        statistics, player performance, and other relevant
                        factors. Correctly predicted 78.9% of season games
                        between 2021 and 2022

                    <p>
                        I developed an AI-driven application in Rust that
                        automatically manages my fantasy football team by making
                        player selection, lineup changes, and trade decisions
                        based on machine learning models trained on historical
                        data and real-time player statistics.

                    <p>
                        I created a program in Python using OpenCV and machine
                        learning techniques to analyze a quarterback's throwing
                        form captured in video footage. The program detects
                        flaws in the form and provide feedback on areas of
                        improvement.
